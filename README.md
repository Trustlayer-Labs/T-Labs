# Trustlayer Labs

**Enterprise-Grade AI Compliance Agent for GDPR & Social Engineering Threats**

---

## 📈 Project Overview

**Trustlayer Labsl** is a stateful, multi-channel compliance monitoring system powered by the **Portia AI SDK**. It acts as an intelligent layer of protection across your organisation's internal communications — detecting policy violations, preventing sensitive data leaks, and flagging suspicious behavioural patterns such as social engineering attempts.

It not only monitors **Slack**, **meeting transcripts**, and (optionally) **email**, but also utilises powerful LLMs to provide explainable, contextual, and actionable risk analysis. The system simulates the workflow of an enterprise-grade compliance officer: observe, assess, escalate if needed — all with full transparency and human oversight.

## 📄 Key Features

### 🔍 Intelligent Policy Violation Detection
- Applies company policy rules (GDPR + Social Engineering) via structured RAG
- Scans Slack conversations and meeting transcripts in real time
- Detects:
  - Personal data exposure (GDPR Article 4)
  - Unauthorised data sharing (GDPR Article 28)
  - Poor data protection practices (GDPR Article 32)
  - Social engineering risk phrases and tactics

### 🧠 LLM Risk Engine with Explanation
- Uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** (Google Generative AI)
- Returns structured reasoning in JSON format:
  - Matched policy clause
  - Confidence score
  - Risk level (low/medium/high)
  - Recommended action (ignore, redact, escalate)
  - Natural-language explanation of what was risky and why

### 🧳 Stateful Memory for Users
- Tracks number of violations per user
- Automatically escalates after repeated offences
- Implements per-user ignore timers ("Ignore for 24 hours")

### 📬 Email Escalation & Manager Review
- High-risk violations generate real-time email to compliance manager
- Email includes:
  - Violation context
  - Explanation
  - Call-to-action link for escalation confirmation
- Flask-based portal for managers to confirm or dismiss escalations

### 🧠 Human-in-the-Loop
- Manager actions recorded in logs
- Supports full audit trail for traceability and accountability
